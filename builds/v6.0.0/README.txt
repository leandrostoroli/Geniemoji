How does Geniemoji work?
- Geniemoji lives in your Menu Bar once the app is launched
- The Menu Bar is at the bottom on Windows & it's top on MacOS and Linux
- The app doesn't show up in the dock or anywhere else
- You can summon Geniemoji using either the shortcut keys: Control + E or by pressing its icon in the menu bar
- You can close Geniemoji by pressing Escape or clicking anywhere outside the app
- The shortcut keys are the same across all operating systems
