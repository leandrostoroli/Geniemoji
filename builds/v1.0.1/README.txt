How does Geniemoji work?
- Geniemoji lives in your Menu Bar once the app is launched
- The app doesn't show up in the dock or anywhere else
- You can summon Geniemoji using either the shortcut keys: Control + e or by pressing its icon in the menu bar
- The shortcut keys are the same across all operating systems
